SScript Editor
--------------

### Description
SScript Editor is a simple editor for SScript (see my other projects on GitHub for compiler and virtual machine).

It's written in Pascal (Lazarus, precisely).

I made it mainly out of boredom - it's nothing, comparing to eg.Lazarus, but I'm still developing and proud of it :)


All tutorials are - as for now - written only in Polish: http://sscript.4programmers.net/
... but soon I'm going to translate them to English ;)

### Downloading
There are 2 branches:

-master (this is the "live" version of code - it's untested and most likely unstable; use only if you know what are you doing)

-stable (this is the latest stable and tested version of code; also - it has compiled binaries)

Ready-to-use, stable builds are downloadable in `/build` in `stable` branch.

### Contributing
You want to contribute? It's great :)


You can contribute in 2 ways:

1.By reporting an issue or suggestion (and then me or somebody else will try to fix/add it)

2.By writing/fixing already written code; if you don't know how, read an article, eg.http://www.lornajane.net/posts/2010/contributing-to-projects-on-github


Thanks for help!
