SScript Editor
--------------

### Description
SScript Editor is a simple editor for SScript (see my other projects on GitHub for compiler and virtual machine).
It's written in Pascal (Lazarus, precisely).
I made it mainly out of boredom - it's nothing, comparing to eg.Lazarus, but I'm still developing and proud of it ;)

### Contributing
You want to contribute? It's great :)

You can contribute in 2 ways:
1.By reporting an issue or suggestion (and then me or somebody else will try to fix/add it)
2.By writing/fixing already written code; if you don't know how, read an article, eg.http://www.lornajane.net/posts/2010/contributing-to-projects-on-github

Thanks for help!

### But the code isn't readable...
I know - some parts of code are written... weakly; and there's no documentation for code as-is.
But if you're not sure about some part of code, just write a message to me and I'll try to answer.
And about the documentation - if I'll find some free time, I'll try to write it.
